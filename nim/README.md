lack of getting started tutorials, at least on the same quality as rust

found nimble as a package manager

immediately encountered difficult figuring out how to handle command line args

decided to move on to hashing

found a hash library easily, but got stuck on reading a file in chunks

at this time, does not seem to be enough community support, as measured by lack
of tutorial content online
