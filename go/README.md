getting started is easy

compiler is very forgiving, data types are similar to C

have to define data types explicitly, which feels redundant sometimes; for
example, if I declare the return type of a function, then I shouldn't need to
define it inside the function. Maybe it's possible and I just don't know how to
yet.

gofmt is nice so I don't have to worry about the formatting, like it or love
it, it is consistent

heavy emphasis on error handling code, much more in your face than other
languages; personally, I still prefer Python's 'try/except/raise' approach;
