Cargo is awesome

Syntax is good and logical

Mangling Path, PathBuf, strings, is a huge hassle

Vim linter is great, it shows problems immediately (they also show up on
'cargo run')

Learning to deal with mut and & is confusing. When an error is reported, I
often just stick a & in front or add mut to see if it fixes it, probably should
learn more about how it works :) On the bright side, generally if I can get it
to compile, it will work!
